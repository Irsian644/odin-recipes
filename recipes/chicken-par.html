    <h3><em>Easy Chicken Parmesan Casserole: A Comforting One-Dish Classic</em></h3>
    <p>
        This comforting and fuss-free casserole transforms classic chicken Parmesan into a simple, satisfying one-dish meal. 
        Tender rotini pasta is combined with cooked chicken (either freshly cubed, rotisserie, or canned), gooey mozzarella cheese, and rich marinara sauce. 
        The mix is topped with a layer of seasoned breadcrumbs, covered with foil, and baked until the cheese melts delightfully—about 35 minutes—resulting in golden, bubbly perfection. 
        With just 5 minutes of prep and 45 minutes of bake time, it yields six generous servings, each packing a balanced 359 calories, 24g of protein, and a pleasing blend of flavors that makes it a go-to weeknight favorite
