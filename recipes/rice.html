            <li>4 cups cold cooked brown or white rice (preferably medium-grain, day-old)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce or tamari</li>
            <li>1½ teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon ground white pepper, plus more as needed</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon toasted sesame oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Mince 3 garlic cloves. 
                Thinly slice 2 medium scallions crosswise on a slight diagonal, keeping the white parts separate from the light and dark green parts.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil in a large wok or nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat until shimmering. 
                Add the garlic, scallion whites, and 1 cup frozen peas and carrots. 
                Stir-fry until the carrots and peas are thawed, about 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add 4 cups cold cooked rice, breaking up any clumps of rice with your fingers as you add it in. 
                Toss to combine with the peas and carrots. 
                Add 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, and 3/4 teaspoon ground white pepper. 
                Stir to combine.
            </li>
            <li>
                Push the fried rice to one side of the pan. 
                Add the remaining 1 teaspoon vegetable oil to the now-empty side of the pan, then crack 2 large eggs into the oil. 
                Scramble into fluffy curds until almost set.
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn off the heat and stir the eggs into the fried rice, breaking up any large pieces of egg. 
                Drizzle with 3/4 teaspoon toasted sesame oil and toss to combine. 
                Taste and season with more kosher salt and white pepper as needed. 
                Garnish with the reserved scallion greens.
            </li>
        </ol>
